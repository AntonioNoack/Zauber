# C/C++ Compiler

While C++ is one hell of a language,
we should be able to extract function signatures from normal C and C++ easily enough,
such that we can compile them.

For C code, we might be able to read it like Kotlin code, and compile it ourselves (like TinyCCompiler, just that we have LLVM helping us out).
