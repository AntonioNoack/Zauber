package me.anno.libraries

// todo TOML-style format like in Rust with cargo to add libraries,
//  but we don't want to store anything ourselves,
//  so you just specify links to the GitHub or GitLab repositories,
//  and say which branch to pull,
// todo and we have some global cache folder,
//  where we place these, and at build time, we include their src folders?
//  maybe some project file...
//  or do we want a Zig-style build script?
