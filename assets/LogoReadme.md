# The Logo

I've first created it using Z-Image Turbo
https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo

with the following prompt:
```
Anime style fox head, with a witch hat for a logo.
The fox looks cute, but still intelligent.
The background is white.
```

Then I've removed the background using BiRefNet with maskOffset=-1, and finally touched up the background removal in Gimp
(because the right eye was transparent).

License of the image:
as it is mostly AI generated, and I like subprojects in Rust using modified language logos,
this image is in the public domain. Do whatever you want with it, I just don't like gory stuff.
